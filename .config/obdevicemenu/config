# Set whether notifications will be shown. This can be "0" or "1".

# Set notification command path and options to pass. These are only used if

# Set optical device location. This string is matched using grep like so:
# udisks --enumerate | grep -ow ${optical_devices} | sort
# If you wish to do more complicated matches, the string can be modified to
# include grep options, such as setting it to "-e sr0 -e sr[2-9]". This
# allows more control over which devices are processed/ignored by the menu.
#optical_devices="sr[0-9]*"
#optical_devices="-E ^/dev/sr[0-9]+"

# Set removable devices location. The default is to ignore /dev/sda*, which is
# usually the primary system drive. This string is matched using grep like so:
# udisks --enumerate | grep -ow ${removable_devices} | sort
# If you wish to do more complicated matches, the string can be modified to
# include grep options, such as setting it to "-e sdb[0-9]* -e sdc1". This
# allows more control over which devices are processed/ignored by the menu.

### This example also includes LUKS encrypted partitions:
### removable_devices="-E ^/dev/sd[b-z][0-9]*|^/dev/mmcblk[0-9]+p*[0-9]*|^/dev/dm-[0-9]+"
###
### This example also includes LUKS encrypted partitions but hides /dev/dm-0 to
### /dev/dm-7 which are system partitions:
### removable_devices="-E ^/dev/sd[b-z][0-9]*|^/dev/dm-[8-9]|^/dev/dm-[1-9][0-9]+"
###
### This example also includes floppy drives (note that the device will always
### be shown whether or not there is a floppy disk inserted):
### removable_devices="-E ^/dev/sd[b-z][0-9]*|^/dev/fd[0-9]+"

# Do not show internal devices. This can be "0" or "1". If you have system
# drives that are always found at the same location (e.g. /dev/sda), it is
# better and faster to hide them using the "removable_devices" option above.

# Set whether to show the device filename in the menu. This can be "0" or "1".
# Example: If this is set to "1" then the menu entry will show "sdb1: Cruzer",
# while if this is set to "0" then the menu entry will only show "Cruzer".
show_removable_device_filename="0"
show_optical_device_filename="1"

# Set whether to sort devices more thoroughly. This can be "0" or "1".
# This option is basically a big hack to get around a shortcoming of the sort
# command, which causes /dev/sdc11 to be shown in the menu before /dev/sdc2.
# It will deal with /dev/sd* and /dev/dm-* devices, but not /dev/mmcblk* as
# the sorting is not really that simple. It is a big hack so if you enable it
# then i can make no promises that it will be fast or bug free.

# Set custom commands to be run automatically after mounting or unmounting.
# This is useful for spinning down a hard drive after unmounting it. The
# device name (e.g. /dev/sdb1) is passed as the first and only argument.
# Uncomment the examples below, or modify them to pass any arbitrary commands.
# post_mount is run immediately after a successful mount operation, and
# post_unmount is run immediately after a successful unmount operation.
# Note that these examples date from UDISKS not UDISKS2.

# Set "run_post_mount" to "0" to disable or "1" to enable.
run_post_mount="1"

# This example uses udisks to set the spindown timeout after mounting.
#post_mount() {
#	udisks --set-spindown ${1} --spindown-timeout 240
#}

# Set "run_post_unmount" to "0" to disable or "1" to enable.

# This example uses udisks to set the spindown timeout after unmounting.
#post_unmount() {
#	udisks --set-spindown ${1} --spindown-timeout 240

# Set default mount options for Udisks.
# These don't really work right now.
